# AVL Tree

An AVL tree is a self-balancing form of a [binary search tree](../Binary Search Tree/), in which the height of subtrees differ at most by only 1.

A binary tree is *balanced* when its left and right subtrees contain roughly the same number of nodes. That is what makes searching the tree really fast. But if a binary search tree is unbalanced, searching can become really slow.

This is an example of an unbalanced tree:

![Unbalanced tree](Images/Unbalanced.png)

All the children are in the left branch and none are in the right. This is essentially the same as a [linked list](../Linked List/) and as a result, searching takes **O(n)** time instead of the much faster **O(log n)** that you'd expect from a binary search tree.

A balanced version of that tree would look like this:

One way to make the binary search tree balanced is to insert the nodes in a totally random order. But that doesn't guarantee success, nor is it always practical.

The other solution is to use a *self-balancing* binary tree. This type of data structure adjusts the tree to keep it balanced after you insert or delete nodes. The height of such a tree is guaranteed to be *log(n)* where *n* is the number nodes. On a balanced tree all insert, remove, and search operations take **O(log n)** time. That means fast. ;-)

## AVL tree

An AVL tree fixes any imbalances by "rotating" the tree to the left or right.

A node in an AVL tree is considered balanced if its subtrees differ in "height" by at most 1. The tree itself is balanced if all its nodes are balanced.

The *height* of a node is how many steps it takes to get to that node's lowest leaf. For example, in the following tree it takes three steps to go from A to E, so the height of A is 3. The height of B is 2, the height of C is 1, and the height of the others is 0 because they are leaf nodes.

As mentioned, in an AVL tree a node is balanced if its left and right subtree have the same height. It doesn't have to be the exact same height, but the difference may not be greater than 1. These are all examples of balanced trees:

![Balanced trees](Images/BalanceOK.png)

But these are trees that are unbalanced, because the height of the left subtree is too large compared to the right subtree:

![Unbalanced trees](Images/BalanceNotOK.png)

The difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees is called the *balance factor*. It is calculated as follows:

	balance factor = abs(height(left subtree) - height(right subtree))

If after an insertion or deletion the balance factor becomes greater than 1, then we need to re-balance this part of the AVL tree. And that is done with rotations.

## Rotations

[TODO]

Inserting into the tree is similar to Binary Tree but differs by one additional opeartion which updates the `balance` variable.

Insertion never needs more than 2 rotations. Removal might require up to lg n rotations.

## The code

Most of the code in [AVLTree.swift](AVLTree.swift) is just regular [binary search tree](../Binary Search Tree/) stuff. You'll find this in any implementation of a binary search tree. For example, searching the tree is exactly the same. The only things that an AVL tree does slightly differently is inserting and deleting the nodes.

The interesting bits are in the following methods:

- `methodName()`
- TODO

AVL tree was the first self-balancing binary tree. These days, the [red-black tree](../Red-Black Tree/) seems to be more common.
